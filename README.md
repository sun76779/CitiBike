# Tableau Assignment - Citi Bike Analytics

## Question

* How many trips have been recorded total during the chosen period? 
 	Total 344,038 trips have being recorded during Oct.2017-Sep.2018.

* By what percentage has total ridership grown? 
	See Tab "Ridership Grown % vs. Short-Term Customers Grown"
	
* How has the proportion of short-term customers and annual subscribers changed?
	See Tab "Ridership Grown % vs. Short-Term Customers Grown"

* What are the peak hours in which bikes are used during summer months? 
	See Tab "Summer Peak"

* What are the peak hours in which bikes are used during winter months?
	See Tab "Winter Peak"
	
* Today, what are the top 10 stations in the city for starting a journey? (Based on data, why do you hypothesize these are the top locations?)
	See Tab "Top 10 Start Station". I assume these ten locations are closer to central park loop, busy subway stations, etc.

* Today, what are the top 10 stations in the city for ending a journey? (Based on data, why?)
	See Tab "Top 10 Ending Station". 

* Today, what are the bottom 10 stations in the city for starting a journey? (Based on data, why?)
	See Tab "Bottom 10 Start Station". 

* Today, what are the bottom 10 stations in the city for ending a journey (Based on data, why?)
	See Tab "Bottom 10 Ending Station". 

* Today, what is the gender breakdown of active participants (Male v. Female)?
	See Tab "Gender" 

* How effective has gender outreach been in increasing female ridership over the timespan?
	See Tab "Female Ridership". 

* How does the average trip duration change by age?
	See Tab "Age vs. Duration"

* What is the average distance in miles that a bike is ridden?
	See Tab "Avg Dist/Trip"

* Which bikes (by ID) are most likely due for repair or inspection in the timespan? 
	See Tab "Bike in R&M". Sorting by # of BikeID, which appare least during the year.

* How variable is the utilization by bike ID?

**Additionally, city officials would like to see the following visualizations:**

* A static map that plots all bike stations with a visual indication of the most popular locations to start and end a journey with zip code data overlaid on top.

* If you're working with a merged dataset: a dynamic map that shows how each station's popularity changes over time (by month and year) -- with commentary pointing to any interesting events that may be behind these phenomena.

**Lastly, as a chronic over-achiever:**

* Find at least two unexpected phenomena in the data and provide a visualization and analysis to document their presence.
